    "When creating a custom exception in Python, it is important to use the Exception class as the base class for the new exception. This is because Exception is the built-in base class for all exceptions in Python, and using it as the base class for a custom exception allows the new exception to inherit all the behavior and properties of the built-in exception class.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the Exception class as the base class, the custom exception will have access to important features such as the ability to define custom error messages, traceback information, and other error handling behavior that is expected by Python's exception handling system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, using the Exception class as the base class for a custom exception makes it easier for other developers to understand the nature of the exception and its intended usage. It is also a best practice to use the Exception class as the base class, as it ensures consistency with other Python code and makes it easier to maintain and debug the code over time."

    "1. Be specific with exception handling: Catch only the exceptions that you can handle and don't use a generic catch-all exception block. This will help you to debug your code more easily and handle errors more effectively.\n",
